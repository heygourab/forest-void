## What's in the folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your color theme extension.
- `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme of the theme.
- `themes/Forest Void-color-theme.json` - the color theme definition file.

## Get up and running straight away (for development)

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Open the color theme picker with the `File > Preferences > Theme > Color Theme` menu item, or use the `Preferences: Color Theme` command (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+T`) and pick your theme.
- Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Make changes (for development)

- Changes to the theme file are automatically applied to the Extension Development Host window.
